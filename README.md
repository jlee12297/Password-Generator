# Password-Generator
generates password based on the user's selected requirements
This deployed site, upon clicking of the generate password button by the user, will give the user a series of prompts to find out which specific types of characters the user would want in their randomly generated password, as well as allowing the user to choose a length for their password between 8-128 characters.
